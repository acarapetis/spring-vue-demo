# spring-vue-demo

A simple demonstration web application built quickly with Spring Boot, Vue.js
and Bootstrap. Works in (current versions of) Firefox, Chrome and Edge.
Definitely does not work in Internet Explorer. (See
`src/main/resources/static/index.html` for some comments on compatibility.)

## Running

If you have maven installed, all you need to do is run `mvn spring-boot:run`.
